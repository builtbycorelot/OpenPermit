# Knowledge Packs (Local Rulelets)

Knowledge packs are versioned, MIT-licensed local rulelets that evaluate models deterministically (e.g., clearance, clash proximity, egress width). They return structured findings that become `Assertion` nodes. Runtime implementation is out of scope for this update; this page defines the concept and interface expectations.
