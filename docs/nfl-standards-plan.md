# Node Form Language – Standards Grounding Plan

This plan outlines how the Node Form Language (NFL) aligns with widely adopted standards to ensure secure and interoperable permitting workflows. Each referenced standard influences the structure or security posture of the NFL schemas.

## Core Standards

- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** — Establishes the information security management controls used when handling permit data.
- **NIEM 6.0** — Provides the base vocabulary for exchanging data with federal and state systems.
- **ISO 19650** — Guides the organization of BIM documents linked from NFL nodes.
- **CityJSON / OGC InfraGML** — Supports geospatial features present in site plans and inspections.
- **NIST SP 800‑53** — Supplies security and privacy controls for API and workflow implementations.

Together these references ground the Node Form Language in well known industry practices while remaining flexible for local requirements.
