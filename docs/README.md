# OpenPermit Documentation Hub

OpenPermit is an open-source initiative that makes building and energy infrastructure permits faster, clearer, and more predictable. By combining plain-language guidance with standards-based technology, we help communities accelerate affordable housing, modernize energy upgrades, and give every applicant a transparent path to approval.

## Start Here: For Everyone
- **Mission in Plain Language.** OpenPermit streamlines permitting so residents and small businesses spend less time on paperwork and more time building. We partner with municipalities, industry experts, and volunteers to modernize reviews without leaving anyone behind.
- **How we do it.** Our approach is built on five pillars:
  1. [Standardized Vocabulary](standardized_vocabulary.md) — A shared form that works on paper or as JSON, grounded in BLDS, NIEM, and legacy OpenPermit standards.
  2. [Programmatic Interface](programmatic_interface.md) — APIs that let trusted partners submit, track, and integrate permits securely.
  3. [Prescriptive Project Verification](prescriptive_verification.md) — "E-check" style automation that validates compliant projects in minutes.
  4. [Hosted Model Reviews](hosted_model_reviews.md) — Collaborative 3D/2D workspaces for real-time conversations between submitters and reviewers.
  5. [Code Validity Testing](code_validity_testing.md) — Tools that ensure new policy language is both human- and machine-readable.
- **Open invitation.** Whether you are a homeowner, contractor, energy specialist, policy maker, or developer, you are welcome to participate, contribute, and share feedback.

## Get Involved
1. Read the [Repository Overview](../README.md) and [Standards & Processes](../standards.md).
2. Join conversations in the [Project Discussion Board](https://github.com/builtbycorelot/OpenPermit/issues) or open an [issue](https://github.com/builtbycorelot/OpenPermit/issues/new).
3. Contribute code, policy research, or field feedback through pull requests. Be sure to review the [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/SheetPros/OpenPermit/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Security Policy](../SECURITY.md).
4. Share success stories from affordable housing, energy retrofits, and infrastructure modernization projects so we can highlight them for others.

Together we can deliver predictable, equitable permits that match the urgency of housing and energy transformation.
