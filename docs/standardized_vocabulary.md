# Standardized Permit Vocabulary

OpenPermit promotes a common language for permit applications so every participant—homeowners, builders, inspectors, and software vendors—can understand and exchange the same information. The vocabulary builds on battle-tested public standards and keeps paper-based workflows viable while encouraging modern data exchange.

## Goals
- **Clarity for everyone.** A consistent set of field names and definitions eliminates guesswork for permit submitters and reviewers.
- **Interoperability.** Systems built on BLDS, NIEM, and the original OpenPermit schema can translate information without bespoke mapping.
- **Paper and digital parity.** Municipalities that still require paper forms can adopt the same vocabulary used in JSON payloads, keeping legacy processes compatible with digital submissions.

## What is included
- A core data dictionary covering applicant details, site information, scope of work, inspections, and approvals.
- Canonical enumerations for permit types, construction classifications, and review statuses.
- Guidance for extending the vocabulary with local code references while maintaining cross-jurisdiction alignment.

## Where to learn more
- [Legal Standards Mapping](legal_standards_mapping.md) — Shows how code requirements translate into structured data fields.
- [NIEM ↔ NFL Alignment (6.0)](niem-alignment-6.0.md) — Demonstrates how OpenPermit concepts align with NIEM for broader data-sharing initiatives.
- [References](references.md) — Source standards, including BLDS and the legacy OpenPermit vocabulary.

## How to contribute
1. Review the existing [open-data-layer schema](../open-data-layer/schema) and vocabulary enumerations.
2. Propose additions or clarifications through GitHub issues or pull requests.
3. Coordinate with the community to validate changes across jurisdictions before adoption.
