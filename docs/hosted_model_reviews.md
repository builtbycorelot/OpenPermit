# Hosted Model Reviews

OpenPermit supports collaborative review environments where project teams and municipal reviewers engage directly with digital building models. These "review-at-once" sessions reduce miscommunication and accelerate approvals.

## Core concepts
- **Centralized model hosting.** Submitters upload IFC, CityGML, or other supported formats for a shared, authoritative view.
- **In-model commentary.** Participants leave threaded comments pinned to elements, with notifications and change tracking.
- **Version-aware discussions.** Reviewers can compare revisions, resolve issues, and maintain a full audit trail.

## Integration highlights
- Syncs with the [prescriptive verification](prescriptive_verification.md) pipeline to highlight code compliance flags inside the model.
- Connects to the [programmatic interface](programmatic_interface.md) so status updates and review notes stay in sync.
- Supports attachments, markups, and snapshots for agencies that require external archives.

## Why it matters
- Eliminates the back-and-forth of static PDFs and email threads.
- Encourages collaboration between architects, engineers, energy specialists, and inspectors.
- Creates a transparent record of decisions for future audits.

## Next steps
- Contribute viewer adapters or integrations with open-source BIM viewers.
- Share feedback from pilot implementations in the [Project Discussion Board](https://github.com/builtbycorelot/OpenPermit/issues).
- Help design accessibility features so every reviewer can participate effectively.
