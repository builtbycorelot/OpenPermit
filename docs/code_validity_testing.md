# Code Validity Testing

As building and energy codes evolve, municipalities must ensure new language can be interpreted by both people and machines. OpenPermit promotes semantic testing so that policy updates are ready for automation from day one.

## Objectives
- **Human readability.** Draft code remains clear to residents, contractors, and inspectors.
- **Machine readability.** Rules can be expressed in logic engines without ambiguity.
- **Lifecycle management.** Changes include provenance, effective dates, and rollback plans.

## Testing approach
1. Model code provisions as structured logic or decision tables.
2. Validate logic against historical permit scenarios and edge cases.
3. Capture feedback from reviewers and policy experts to refine wording.
4. Publish approved changes alongside open-source test cases.

## Supporting resources
- [References](references.md) — Standards and research on digital code authoring.
- [Public Policy Alignment](nfl-standards-plan.md) — Roadmap for ISO, NIEM, and related compliance.
- [Prescriptive Project Verification](prescriptive_verification.md) — Downstream consumers of machine-readable code.

## How to contribute
- Propose semantic tests or share open-source rule engines for evaluation.
- Document assumptions and jurisdiction-specific nuances in pull requests.
- Collaborate with policy makers during drafting to flag ambiguous language early.
