# Spotsylvania Permit Schema

This directory contains JSON-LD representations of permit data collected from Spotsylvania County, Virginia.

- `spotsylvania.json` defines permit, document, and property types used by the county.
- `spotsylvania_crosswalk.json` maps those property fields to equivalent terms in the Building and Land Development Specification (BLDS) so details are not lost when translating to other standards.
