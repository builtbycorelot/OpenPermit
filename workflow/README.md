# Workflow

This directory contains example workflow definitions and utilities.

## Validation

Install the required dependency:

```bash
pip install pyld
```

To check that `workflow.jsonld` is valid JSON-LD, run:

```bash
python validate_workflow.py
```

You can also run the root `validate_repo.py` script to execute all repository
validation steps at once.
