# OpenPermit Demo

This repository is configured for GitHub Pages so stakeholders can review a running demo without any additional setup.

- **Interactive Demo**: [example/index.html](example/index.html) shows the core library in action.
- **Mobile Ready**: the demo layout uses responsive styles so it works well on phones and tablets.
- **Static Hosting**: the application is pure client-side JavaScript and can be hosted on any static server or CDN.

For development prerequisites and instructions, see [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md).
